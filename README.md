# if-elif-and-else
The first set of code shows the use of the if, elif and else key words
This code makes it possible to interact with the user, giving options to what could be the possible response and produces outputs depending on the answers of said user.
The second set of code is brief and goes straight to the point. I like to call it the (either, or) keys.  Using the if and else code make provision for only two answer and therefore the nickname (either, or).
